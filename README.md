# tractor_dev_env_test

I'm borrowing some code here: the `tractor_control_params` and
`tractor_joint_params` files, and the `ackermann_controller` and
`cmd_vel_to_ackermann` code is modified from
[[https://github.com/hdh7485/ackermann_vehicle]]. I used the URDF from that
repo as a starting point but it's pretty heavily modified. The rest is pretty
bog-standard ros boilerplate.
